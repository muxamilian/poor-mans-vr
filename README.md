The front camera tracks the head's location and changes the perspective of the content on the phone depending on the head's position. The resulting effect is that the phone screen is like a window and the object in the video is seen through the window. This is especially useful for ultra-wide videos, which can capture a scene using a wide angle. Viewers can then expercience the scene in a more immersive way because when changing their viewpoint, the content changes its position accordingly.
