Neural networks track the head's position using the front camera and tensorflow.js. The content on the phone changes its position depending on the head's position. The resulting effect is that the phone screen is like a window and the object in the video is seen through the window. 

This is especially useful for ultra-wide videos, which can capture a scene using a wide angle. Viewers can then expercience the scene in a more immersive way because when changing their viewpoint, the content changes its position accordingly.

To use this tech on your website, you have to include the js and css files like in the demo above. Then you have to add a div on your website, which displays the content you want to benefit from the VR effect.
